        PhyQuiz is an application designed for students to learn the Kinematics and Newton's Law of Motion in Physics. Furthermore, PhyQuiz focuses on breaking the concepts down into simple and manageable parts, which can help students understand the relationship between the concepts better. This is achieved through clear explanations and quizzes that the students may answer which help in simplifying complex concepts. PhyQuiz will also offers features that cater to different learning styles, allowing students to learn at their own pace. This approach enables learners to have a more personalized experience and increases retention. One of the rationales behind creating PhyQuiz is to provide a modern and accessible method of learning the Kinematics and Newton's Law of Motion. It will provide modules and quizzes to the students that may answer to test their knowledge about it.
