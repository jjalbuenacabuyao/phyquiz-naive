## The Meaning of Shape for a v-t Graph

Our study of 1-dimensional kinematics has been concerned with the multiple means by which the motion of objects can be represented. Such means include the use of words, the use of diagrams, the use of numbers, the use of equations, and the use of graphs. Lesson 4 focuses on the use of  **velocity versus time graphs**  to describe motion. As we will learn, the specific features of the motion of objects are demonstrated by the shape and the slope of the lines on a velocity vs. time graph. The first part of this lesson involves a study of the relationship between the shape of a v-t graph and the motion of the object.

## **Constant Velocity versus Changing Velocity**

Consider a car moving with a **constant, rightward (+) velocity** - say of +10 m/s. [As learned in an earlier lesson](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1e.cfm), a car moving with a constant velocity is a car with zero acceleration.

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture32.gif)

If the velocity-time data for such a car were graphed, then the resulting graph would look like the graph at the right. Note that a motion described as a constant, positive velocity results in a line of zero slope (a horizontal line has zero slope) when plotted as a velocity-time graph. Furthermore, only positive velocity values are plotted, corresponding to a motion with positive velocity.

![Picture33](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture33.gif)

Now consider a car moving with a **rightward (+), changing velocity** - that is, a car that is moving rightward but speeding up or [accelerating](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1e.cfm). Since the car is moving in the positive direction and speeding up, the car is said to have a [positive acceleration](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1e.cfm#dirn).

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture34.gif)

If the velocity-time data for such a car were graphed, then the resulting graph would look like the graph at the right. Note that a motion described as a changing, positive velocity results in a sloped line when plotted as a velocity-time graph. The slope of the line is positive, corresponding to the positive acceleration. Furthermore, only positive velocity values are plotted, corresponding to a motion with positive velocity.

![Picture35](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture35.gif)

The velocity vs. time graphs for the two types of motion - constant velocity and changing velocity (acceleration) - can be summarized as follows.



​	**Positive Velocity**
​	**Zero Acceleration**

## **The Importance of Slope**

The shapes of the velocity vs. time graphs for these two basic types of motion - constant velocity motion and [accelerated motion](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1e.cfm) (i.e., changing velocity) - reveal an important principle. The principle is that  **the slope of the line on a velocity-time graph reveals useful information about the acceleration of the object**. If the acceleration is zero, then the slope is zero (i.e., a horizontal line). If the acceleration is positive, then the slope is positive (i.e., an upward sloping line). If the acceleration is negative, then the slope is negative (i.e., a downward sloping line). This very principle can be extended to any conceivable motion.

The slope of a velocity-time graph reveals information about an object's acceleration. But how can one tell whether the object is moving in the positive direction (i.e., positive velocity) or in the negative direction (i.e., negative velocity)? And how can one tell if the object is speeding up or slowing down?

#### **Positive Velocity versus Negative Velocity**

The answers to these questions hinge on one's ability to read a graph. Since the graph is a velocity-time graph, the velocity would be positive whenever the line lies in the positive region (above the x-axis) of the graph. Similarly, the velocity would be negative whenever the line lies in the negative region (below the x-axis) of the graph. As learned in [Lesson 1](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1d.cfm#dirn), a positive velocity means the object is moving in the positive direction; and a negative velocity means the object is moving in the negative direction. So one knows an object is moving in the positive direction if the line is located in the positive region of the graph (whether it is sloping up or sloping down). And one knows that an object is moving in the negative direction if the line is located in the negative region of the graph (whether it is sloping up or sloping down). And finally, if a line crosses over the x-axis from the positive region to the negative region of the graph (or vice versa), then the object has changed directions.

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture38.gif)

## **Speeding Up versus Slowing Down**

Now how can one tell if the object is speeding up or slowing down? Speeding up means that the magnitude (or numerical value) of the velocity is getting large. For instance, an object with a velocity changing from +3 m/s to + 9 m/s is speeding up. Similarly, an object with a velocity changing from -3 m/s to -9 m/s is also speeding up. In each case, the magnitude of the velocity (the number itself, not the sign or direction) is increasing; the speed is getting bigger. Given this fact, one would believe that an object is speeding up if the line on a velocity-time graph is changing from near the 0-velocity point to a location further away from the 0-velocity point. That is, if the line is getting further away from the x-axis (the 0-velocity point), then the object is speeding up. And conversely, if the line is approaching the x-axis, then the object is slowing down.

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture39.gif)

### **EXAMPLE**

Consider the graph at the right. The object whose motion is represented by this graph is ... (include all that are true):

a. moving in the positive direction.

b. moving with a constant velocity.

c. moving with a negative velocity.

d. slowing down.

e. changing directions.

f. speeding up.

g. moving with a positive acceleration.

h. moving with a constant acceleration.



Answers:  **a, d and h**  apply.



a: TRUE since the line is in the positive region of the graph.

b. FALSE since there is an acceleration (i.e., a changing velocity).

c. FALSE since a negative velocity would be a line in the negative region (i.e., below the horizontal axis).

d. TRUE since the line is approaching the 0-velocity level (the x-axis).

e. FALSE since the line never crosses the axis.

f. FALSE since the line is not moving away from x-axis.

g. FALSE since the line has a negative or downward slope.

h. TRUE since the line is straight (i.e, has a constant slope).

## The Meaning of Slope for a v-t Graph

As discussed in the previous part of Lesson 4, the shape of a velocity versus time graph reveals pertinent information about an object's acceleration. For example, if the acceleration is zero, then the velocity-time graph is a horizontal line (i.e., the slope is zero). If the acceleration is positive, then the line is an upward sloping line (i.e., the slope is positive). If the acceleration is negative, then the velocity-time graph is a downward sloping line (i.e., the slope is negative). If the acceleration is great, then the line slopes up steeply (i.e., the slope is great). This principle can be extended to any motion conceivable. Thus the shape of the line on the graph (horizontal, sloped, steeply sloped, mildly sloped, etc.) is descriptive of the object's motion. In this part of the lesson, we will examine how the actual slope value of any straight line on a velocity-time graph is the acceleration of the object.

### **Analyzing a Constant Velocity Motion**

Consider a car moving with a constant velocity of +10 m/s. A car moving with a constant velocity has an [acceleration](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1e.cfm) of 0 m/s/s.

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture40.gif)

The velocity-time data and graph would look like the graph below. Note that the line on the graph is horizontal. That is the slope of the line is 0 m/s/s. In this case, it is obvious that the slope of the line (0 m/s/s) is the same as the acceleration (0 m/s/s) of the car.

| Time (s) | Velocity (m/s) |
| -------- | -------------- |
| 0        | 10             |
| 1        | 10             |
| 2        | 10             |
| 3        | 10             |
| 4        | 10             |
| 5        | 10             |

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture41.gif)



So in this case, the slope of the line is equal to the acceleration of the velocity-time graph. Now we will examine a few other graphs to see if this is a principle that is true of all velocity versus time graphs.

### **Analyzing a Changing Velocity Motion**

Now consider a car moving with a changing velocity. A car with a changing velocity will have an acceleration.

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture42.gif)

The velocity-time data for this motion show that the car has an acceleration value of 10 m/s/s.Note that the line on the graph is diagonal - that is, it has a slope. The slope of the line can be calculated as 10 m/s/s. The slope of the line can be calculated as 10 m/s/s. It is obvious once again that the slope of the line (10 m/s/s) is the same as the acceleration (10 m/s/s) of the car.

| Time (s) | Velocity (m/s) |
| -------- | -------------- |
| 0        | 1              |
| 1        | 10             |
| 2        | 20             |
| 3        | 30             |
| 4        | 40             |
| 5        | 50             |

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture43.gif)



### **Analyzing a Two-Stage Motion**

In both instances above - the constant velocity motion and the changing velocity motion, the slope of the line was equal to the acceleration. As a last illustration, we will examine a more complex case - a two-stage motion. Consider the motion of a car that first travels with a constant velocity (a=0 m/s/s) of 2 m/s for four seconds and then accelerates at a rate of +2 m/s/s for four seconds. That is, in the first four seconds, the car is not changing its velocity (the velocity remains at 2 m/s) and then the car increases its velocity by 2 m/s per second over the next four seconds. The velocity-time data and graph are displayed below. Observe the relationship between the slope of the line during each four-second interval and the corresponding acceleration value.

| Time (s) | Velocity (m/s) |
| -------- | -------------- |
| 0        | 2              |
| 1        | 2              |
| 2        | 2              |
| 3        | 2              |
| 4        | 2              |
| 5        | 4              |
| 6        | 6              |
| 7        | 8              |
| 8        | 10             |

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture44.gif)



**From 0 s to 4 s: slope = 0 m/s/s
From 4 s to 8 s: slope = 2 m/s/s**



A motion such as the one above further illustrates the important principle: the slope of the line on a velocity-time graph is equal to the acceleration of the object. This principle can be used for all velocity-time in order to determine the numerical value of the acceleration.

### **EXAMPLE**

![Picture45](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture45.gif)

The velocity-time graph for a two-stage rocket is shown below. Use the graph and your understanding of slope calculations to determine the acceleration of the rocket during the listed time intervals.

1. t = 0 - 1 second

**Answer:** The acceleration is  **+40 m/s/s**. The acceleration is found from a slope calculation. The line rises +40 m/s for every 1 second of run.

1. t = 1 - 4 second

**Answer:** The acceleration is  **+20 m/s/s**. The acceleration is found from a slope calculation. The line rises +60 m/s for 3 seconds of run. The rise/run ratio is +20 m/s/s.

1. t = 4 - 12 second

**Answer:** The acceleration is  **-20 m/s/s**. The acceleration is found from a slope calculation. The line rises -160 m/s for 8 seconds of run. The rise/run ratio is -20 m/s/s.

## **Relating the Shape to the Motion**

As discussed in a [previous part](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L4a.cfm) of Lesson 4, the shape of a velocity vs. time graph reveals pertinent information about an object's acceleration. For example, if the acceleration is zero, then the velocity-time graph is a horizontal line - having a slope of zero. If the acceleration is positive, then the line is an upward sloping line - having a positive slope. If the acceleration is negative, then the velocity-time graph is a downward sloping line - having a negative slope. If the acceleration is great, then the line slopes up steeply - having a large slope. The shape of the line on the graph (horizontal, sloped, steeply sloped, mildly sloped, etc.) is descriptive of the object's motion. This principle can be extended to any motion conceivable. In this part of the lesson, we will examine how the principle applies to a variety of types of motion. In each diagram below, a short verbal description of a motion is given (e.g., "constant, rightward velocity") and an accompanying _motion diagram_ is shown. Finally, the corresponding velocity-time graph is sketched and an explanation is given. Near the end of this page, a few [practice problems](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/1DKin/Lesson-4/Relating-the-Shape-to-the-Motion#cyu) are given.

**EXAMPLES**

Describe the motion depicted by the following velocity-time graphs. In your descriptions, make reference to the direction of motion (+ or - direction), the velocity and acceleration and any changes in speed (speeding up or slowing down) during the various time intervals (e.g., intervals A, B, and C). When finished, use the button to view the answers.



**ANSWER**

![Picture52](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture52.gif)

The object moves in the + direction at a constant speed - zero acceleration (interval A). The object then continues in the + direction while slowing down with a negative acceleration (interval B). Finally, the object moves at a constant speed in the + direction, slower than before (interval C).



**ANSWER**

![Picture53](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture53.gif)

The object moves in the + direction while slowing down; this involves a negative acceleration (interval A). It then remains at rest (interval B). The object then moves in the - direction while speeding up; this also involves a negative acceleration (interval C).



**ANSWER**

![Picture54](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture54.gif)

The object moves in the + direction with a constant velocity and zero acceleration (interval A). The object then slows down while moving in the + direction (i.e., it has a negative acceleration) until it finally reaches a 0 velocity (stops) (interval B). Then the object moves in the - direction while speeding up; this corresponds to a - acceleration (interval C).

## Determining the Slope on a v-t Graph

It was learned [earlier in Lesson 4](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L4b.cfm) that the slope of the line on a velocity versus time graph is equal to the [acceleration](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1e.cfm) of the object. If the object is moving with an acceleration of +4 m/s/s (i.e., changing its velocity by 4 m/s per second), then the slope of the line will be +4 m/s/s. If the object is moving with an acceleration of -8 m/s/s, then the slope of the line will be -8 m/s/s. If the object has a velocity of 0 m/s, then the slope of the line will be 0 m/s. Because of its importance, a student of physics must have a good understanding of how to calculate the slope of a line. In this part of the lesson, the method for determining the slope of a line on a velocity-time graph will be discussed.

Let's begin by considering the velocity versus time graph below.

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture55.gif)

The line is sloping upwards to the right. But mathematically, by how much does it slope upwards for every 1 second along the horizontal (time) axis? To answer this question we must use the slope equation.

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture56.gif)

---

## **Using the Slope Equation**

The slope equation says that the slope of a line is found by determining the amount of _rise_ of the line between any two points divided by the amount of _run_ of the line between the same two points. A method for carrying out the calculation is

1. Pick two points on the line and determine their coordinates.
2. Determine the difference in y-coordinates for these two points (_rise_).
3. Determine the difference in x-coordinates for these two points (_run_).
4. Divide the difference in y-coordinates by the difference in x-coordinates (rise/run or slope).

The calculations below shows how this method can be applied to determine the slope of the line. Note that three different calculations are performed for three different sets of two points on the line. In each case, the result is the same: the slope is 10 m/s/s.

For points (5 s, 50 m/s) and (0 s, 0 m/s):

Slope = (50 m/s - 0 m/s) / (5 s - 0 s) =  **10 m/s/s**

For points (5 s, 50 m/s) and (2 s, 20 m/s):

Slope = (50 m/s - 20 m/s) / (5 s - 2 s) =  **10 m/s/s**

For points (4 s, 40 m/s) and (3 s, 30 m/s):

Slope = (40 m/s - 30 m/s) / (4 s - 3 s) =  **10 m/s/s**

Observe that regardless of which two points on the line are chosen for the slope calculation, the result remains the same - 10 m/s/s.

![Picture57](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture57.gif)

**EXAMPLE**

Consider the velocity-time graph below. Determine the acceleration (i.e., slope) of the object as portrayed by the graph. Use the button to view the answer.

**ANSWER**

The acceleration (i.e., slope) is  **4 m/s/s**. If you think the slope is 5 m/s/s, then you're making a common mistake. You are picking one point (probably 5 s, 25 m/s) and dividing y/x. Instead you must pick two points (as in the discussed in this part of the lesson) and divide the change in y by the change in x.

### Determining the Area on a v-t Graph

As learned in an [earlier part of this lesson](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L4b.cfm), a plot of velocity-time can be used to determine the acceleration of an object (the slope). In this part of the lesson, we will learn how a plot of velocity versus time can also be used to determine the displacement of an object. For velocity versus time graphs, the area bound by the line and the axes represents the displacement. The diagram below shows three different velocity-time graphs; the shaded regions between the line and the time-axis represent the displacement during the stated time interval.

The shaded area is representative of the displacement during from 0 seconds to 6 seconds. This area takes on the shape of a  **rectangle**  can be calculated using the appropriate equation.

![Picture58](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture58.gif)

The shaded area is representative of the displacement during from 0 seconds to 4 seconds. This area takes on the shape of a  **triangle**  can be calculated using the appropriate equation.

![Picture59](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture59.gif)

The shaded area is representative of the displacement during from 2 seconds to 5 seconds. This area takes on the shape of a  **trapezoid**  can be calculated using the appropriate equation.

![Picture60](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture60.gif)

The method used to find the area under a line on a velocity-time graph depends upon whether the section bound by the line and the axes is a rectangle, a triangle or a trapezoid. Area formulas for each shape are given below.

| **Rectangle** | **Triangle**     | **Trapezoid**            |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Area = b • h  | Area = ½ • b • h | Area = ½ • b • (h1 + h2) |

#### **EXAMPLE**

Now we will look at a few example computations of the area for each of the above geometric shapes. First consider the calculation of the area for a few rectangles. The solution for finding the area is shown for the first example below. The shaded rectangle on the velocity-time graph has a base of 6 s and a height of 30 m/s. Since the area of a rectangle is found by using the formula A = b x h, the area is 180 m (6 s x 30 m/s). That is, the object was displaced 180 meters during the first 6 seconds of motion.

![Picture61](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture61.gif)

Area = b \* h
Area = (6 s) \* (30 m/s)

**Area = 180 m**



Now try the following two practice problems as a check of your understanding. Determine the displacement (i.e., the area) of the object during the first 4 seconds (Practice A) and from 3 to 6 seconds (Practice B).

![Picture62](\Picture62.gif)

The area of a rectangle is determined by multiplying the base by the height.

A = b • h where b = 4 s and h = 30 m/s.

A = (4 s) • (30 m/s) =  **120 m**

That is, the object was displaced 120 m during the first 4 seconds of motion.



![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture63.gif)

The area of a rectangle is determined by multiplying the base by the height.

A = b • h where b = 3 s and h = 30 m/s.

A = (3 s) • (30 m/s) =  **90 m**

That is, the object was displaced 90 m during the interval of time between 3 and 6 seconds.

#### **Calculating the Area of a Triangle**

Now we will look at a few example computations of the area for a few triangles. The solution for finding the area is shown for the first example below. The shaded triangle on the velocity-time graph has a base of 4 seconds and a height of 40 m/s. Since the area of triangle is found by using the formula A = ½ \* b \* h, the area is ½ \* (4 s) \* (40 m/s) = 80 m. That is, the object was displaced 80 meters during the four seconds of motion.

![Picture64](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture64.gif)

Area = ½ \* b \* h
Area = ½ \* (4 s) \* (40 m/s)

**Area = 80 m**



**EXAMPLE**

Now try the following two practice problems as a check of your understanding. Determine the displacement of the object during the first second (Practice A) and during the first 3 seconds (Practice B).

![Picture65](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture65.gif)

The area of a triangle is given by the equation

Area = ½ • b • h where b = 1 s and h = 10 m/s

Area = ½ • (1 s) • (10 m/s) =  **5 m**

That is, the object was displaced 5 m during the first second of motion



![Picture66](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture66.gif)

The area of a triangle is given by the equation

Area = ½ • b • h where b = 3 s and h = 30 m/s

Area = ½ • (3 s) • (30 m/s) =  **45 m**

That is, the object was displaced 45 m during the first second of motion.

#### **Calculating the Area of a Trapezoid**

Finally we will look at a few example computations of the area for a few trapezoids. The solution for finding the area is shown for the first example below. The shaded trapezoid on the velocity-time graph has a base of 2 seconds and heights of 10 m/s (on the left side) and 30 m/s (on the right side). Since the area of trapezoid is found by using the formula **A = ½ \* (b) \* (h1 + h2*)**, the area is 40 m [½ \* (2 s) \* (10 m/s + 30 m/s)]. That is, the object was displaced 40 meters during the time interval from 1 second to 3 seconds.

![Picture67](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture67.gif)

Area = ½ \* b \* (h1 + h2)
Area = ½ \* (2 s) \* (10 m/s + 30 m/s)

**Area = 40 m**



**EXAMPLE**

Now try the following two practice problems as a check of your understanding. Determine the displacement of the object during the time interval from 2 to 3 seconds (Practice A) and during the first 2 seconds (Practice B).

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture68.gif)

The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula

Area = ½ • b • (h1 + h2) where b = 1 s and h1 = 20 m/s and h2 = 30 m/s.

Area = ½ • (1 s) • (20 m/s + 30 m/s) =  **25 m**

That is, the object was displaced 25 m during the time interval from 2 to 3 seconds.



![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture69.gif)

The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula

Area = ½ • b • (h1 + h2) where b = 2 s and h1 = 30 m/s and h2 = 10 m/s

Area = ½ • (2 s) • (30 m/s + 10 m/s) =  **40 m**

That is, the object was displaced 40 m during the time interval from 2 to 3 seconds.



#### **Alternative Method for Trapezoids**

An alternative means of determining the area of a trapezoid involves breaking the trapezoid into a triangle and a rectangle. The areas of the triangle and rectangle can be computed individually; the area of the trapezoid is then the sum of the areas of the triangle and the rectangle. This method is illustrated in the graphic below.

![Picture70](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture70.gif)

Triangle: Area = ½ \* (2 s) \* (20 m/s) = 20 m

Rectangle: Area = (2 s) \* (10 m/s) = 20 m

**Total Area = 20 m + 20 m = 40 m**



It has been learned in this lesson that the area bounded by the line and the axes of a velocity-time graph is equal to the displacement of an object during that particular time period. The area can be identified as a rectangle, triangle, or trapezoid. The area can be subsequently determined using the appropriate formula. Once calculated, this area represents the displacement of the object.
