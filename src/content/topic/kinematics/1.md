title: Describing Motion with Words
---

## Introduction

**Kinematics** is the science of describing the motion of objects using words, diagrams, numbers, graphs, and equations. Kinematics is a branch of mechanics. The goal of any study of kinematics is to develop sophisticated mental models that serve to describe (and ultimately, explain) the motion of real-world objects.

In this lesson, we will investigate the words used to describe the motion of objects. That is, we will focus on the _language_ of kinematics. The hope is to gain a comfortable foundation with the language that is used throughout the study of mechanics. We will study such terms as scalars, vectors, distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration. These words are used with regularity to describe the motion of objects. Your goal should be to become very familiar with their meaning.

## Scalars and Vectors

The mathematical quantities that are used to describe the motion of objects can be divided into two categories. The quantity is either a vector or a scalar. These two categories can be distinguished from one another by their distinct definitions:

- **Scalars**  are quantities that are fully described by a magnitude (or numerical value) alone.

- **Vectors**  are quantities that are fully described by both a magnitude and a direction.

## Distance and Displacement

Distance and displacement are two quantities that may seem to mean the same thing yet have distinctly different definitions and meanings.

- **Distance**  is a [scalar quantity](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1b.cfm) that refers to "how much ground an object has covered" during its motion.

> d = d1 + d2 + d3â€¦

- **Displacement**  is a [vector quantity](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1b.cfm) that refers to "how far out of place an object is"; it is the object's overall change in position.

To understand the distinction between distance and displacement, you must know the definitions. You must also know that a [vector quantity](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1b.cfm) such as displacement is _direction-aware_ and a [scalar quantity](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1b.cfm) such as distance is _ignorant of direction_. When an object changes its direction of motion, displacement takes this direction change into account; heading the opposite direction effectively begins to cancel whatever displacement there once was.

## Speed and Velocity

Just as distance and displacement have distinctly different meanings (despite their similarities), so do speed and velocity.

- **Speed**  is a [scalar quantity](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1b.cfm) that refers to "how fast an object is moving."Speed can be thought of as the rate at which an object covers distance.

- **Velocity**  is a [vector quantity](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1b.cfm) that refers to "the rate at which an object changes its position."

#### **Determining the Direction of the Velocity Vector**

The direction of the velocity vector is simply the same as the direction that an object is moving. It would not matter whether the object is speeding up or slowing down. If an object is moving rightwards, then its velocity is described as being rightwards. If an object is moving downwards, then its velocity is described as being downwards.

#### **Calculating Average Speed and Average Velocity**

The average speed during the course of a motion is often computed using the following formula:

In contrast, the average velocity is often computed using this formula

#### **Average Speed versus Instantaneous Speed**

Since a moving object often changes its speed during its motion, it is common to distinguish between the average speed and the instantaneous speed. The distinction is as follows.

- **Instantaneous Speed**  - the speed at any given instant in time.

- **Average Speed**  - the average of all instantaneous speeds; found simply by a distance/time ratio.

## Acceleration

An often confused quantity, acceleration has a meaning much different than the meaning associated with it by sports announcers and other individuals. The definition of acceleration is:

- **Acceleration**  is a [vector quantity](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1b.cfm) that is defined as the rate at which an object changes its [velocity](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1d.cfm). An object is accelerating if it is changing its velocity.

![Picture1](/images/topics/kinematics/acceleration.jpg)

#### **The Meaning of Constant Acceleration**

Sometimes an accelerating object will change its velocity by the same amount each second.This is referred to as a  **constant acceleration**  since the velocity is changing by a constant amount each second. An object with a constant acceleration should not be confused with an object with a constant velocity. Don't be fooled! If an object is changing its velocity -whether by a constant amount or a varying amount - then it is an accelerating object. And an object with a constant velocity is not accelerating. The data tables below depict motions of objects with a constant acceleration and a changing acceleration. Note that each object has a changing velocity.

#### **Calculating the Average Acceleration**

The average acceleration ( **a** ) of any object over a given interval of time ( **t** ) can be calculated using the equation

![Picture4](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture4.gif)

This equation can be used to calculate the acceleration of the object whose motion is depicted by the [velocity-time data table](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1e.cfm#vttable) above. The velocity-time data in the table shows that the object has an acceleration of 10 m/s/s. The calculation is shown below.

![Picture5](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture5.gif)

Acceleration values are expressed in units of velocity/time. Typical acceleration units include the following:

> **m/s/s
mi/hr/s
km/hr/s
m/s2**

These units may seem a little awkward to a beginning physics student. Yet they are very reasonable units when you begin to consider the definition and equation for acceleration. The reason for the units becomes obvious upon examination of the acceleration equation.

![Picture6](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture6.gif)

Since acceleration is a velocity change over a time, the units on acceleration are velocity units divided by time units - thus (m/s)/s or (mi/hr)/s. The (m/s)/s unit can be mathematically simplified to m/s2.

#### **The Direction of the Acceleration Vector**

Since acceleration is a [vector quantity](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1b.cfm), it has a direction associated with it. The direction of the acceleration vector depends on two things:

- whether the object is speeding up or slowing down

- whether the object is moving in the + or - direction

The general principle for determining the acceleration is:

If an object is slowing down, then its acceleration is in the opposite direction of its motion.

This general principle can be applied to determine whether the sign of the acceleration of an object is positive or negative, right or left, up or down, etc. Consider the two data tables below. In each case, the acceleration of the object is in the _positive_ direction. In Example A, the object is moving in the _positive_ direction (i.e., has a _positive_ velocity) and is speeding up. When an object is speeding up, the acceleration is in the same direction as the velocity. Thus, this object has a  **positive acceleration**. In Example B, the object is moving in the _negative_ direction (i.e., has a negative velocity) and is slowing down. According to our general principle, when an object is slowing down, the acceleration is in the opposite direction as the velocity. Thus, this object also has a **positive acceleration**.

This same general principle can be applied to the motion of the objects represented in the two data tables below. In each case, the acceleration of the object is in the _negative_ direction. In Example C, the object is moving in the _positive_ direction (i.e., has a _positive_ velocity) and is slowing down. According to our principle, when an object is slowing down, the acceleration is in the opposite direction as the velocity. Thus, this object has a  **negative acceleration**. In Example D, the object is moving in the _negative_ direction (i.e., has a _negative_ velocity) and is speeding up. When an object is speeding up, the acceleration is in the same direction as the velocity. Thus, this object also has a  **negative acceleration**.
