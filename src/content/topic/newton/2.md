# The Meaning of Force

A **force** is a push or pull upon an object resulting from the
object\'s interaction with another object. Whenever there is
an interaction between two objects, there is a force upon each of the
objects. When the interaction ceases, the two objects no longer
experience the force. Forces [only] exist as a result of an
interaction.\
\
\
\
 **Contact versus Action-at-a-Distance Forces**

For simplicity sake, all forces (interactions) between objects can be
placed into two broad categories:

-   contact forces, and

-   forces resulting from action-at-a-distance

**Contact forces** are those types of forces that result when the two
interacting objects are perceived to be physically contacting each
other. Examples of contact forces include frictional forces, tensional
forces, normal forces, air resistance forces, and applied forces.

**Action-at-a-distance forces** are those types of forces that result
even when the two interacting objects are not in physical contact with
each other, yet are able to exert a push or pull despite their physical
separation. Examples of action-at-a-distance forces include
gravitational forces. For example, the sun and planets exert
a [[gravitational
pull]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circles/u6l3c.cfm) on
each other despite their large spatial separation. Even when your feet
leave the earth and you are no longer in physical contact with the
earth, there is a gravitational pull between you and the Earth. Electric
forces are action-at-a-distance forces. For example, the protons in the
nucleus of an atom and the electrons outside the nucleus experience an
electrical pull towards each other despite their small spatial
separation. And magnetic forces are action-at-a-distance forces. For
example, two magnets can exert a magnetic pull on each other even when
separated by a distance of a few centimeters

Examples of contact and action-at-distance forces are listed in the
table below.

### **The Newton**

Force is a quantity that is measured using the standard metric unit
known as the **Newton**. A Newton is abbreviated by an \"N.\" To say
\"10.0 N\" means 10.0 Newton of force. One Newton is the amount of force
required to give a 1-kg mass an acceleration of 1 m/s/s. Thus, the
following unit equivalency can be stated:

**1 Newton = 1 kg • m/s2**

**Force is a Vector Quantity**

A force is a vector quantity. [[As learned in an earlier
unit]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1b.cfm),
a vector quantity is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.
To fully describe the force acting upon an object, you must describe
both the magnitude (size or numerical value) and the direction. Thus, 10
Newton is not a full description of the force acting upon an object. In
contrast, 10 Newton, downward is a complete description of the force
acting upon an object; both the magnitude (10 Newton) and the direction
(downward) are given.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image13.png)Because a force is a vector that has a
direction, it is common to represent forces using diagrams in which a
force is represented by an arrow. Such vector diagrams were
introduced [[in an earlier
unit]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L2c.cfm) and
are used throughout the study of physics. The size of the arrow is
reflective of the magnitude of the force and the direction of the arrow
reveals the direction that the force is acting. (Such diagrams are known
as free-body diagrams and are discussed [[later in this
lesson]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l2c.cfm).)
Furthermore, because forces are vectors, the effect of an individual
force upon an object is often canceled by the effect of another force.
For example, the effect of a 20-Newton upward force acting upon a book
is canceled by the effect of a 20-Newton downward force acting upon the
book. In such instances, it is said that the two individual
forces balance each other; there would be no [[unbalanced
force]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1d.cfm#balanced) acting
upon the book.

 

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image14.png)Other situations could be imagined in which two
of the individual vector forces cancel each other (\"balance\"), yet a
third individual force exists that is not balanced by another force. For
example, imagine a book sliding across the rough surface of a table from
left to right. The downward force of gravity and the upward force of the
table supporting the book act in opposite directions and thus balance
each other. However, the force of friction acts leftwards, and there is
no rightward force to balance it. In this case, an [[unbalanced
force]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1d.cfm#balanced) acts
upon the book to change its [[state of
motion]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1c.cfm#state).

|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Applied Force (F_app)**  ![Alt text](/images/topics/newtons-law/applied.jpg)    | An applied force is a force that is applied to an object by a person or another object. If a person is pushing a desk across the room, then there is an applied force acting upon the object. The applied force is the force exerted on the desk by the person.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Gravity Force (also known as Weight) (F_grav)** | The force of gravity is the force with which the earth, moon, or other massively large object attracts another object towards itself. By definition, this is the weight of the object. All objects upon earth experience a force of gravity that is directed "downward" towards the center of the earth. The force of gravity on earth is always equal to the weight of the object as found by the equation: F_grav = m * g, where g = 9.8 N/kg (on Earth) and m = mass (in kg). |
| **Normal Force (F_norm)**  ![Alt text](/images/topics/newtons-law/normal.jpg)     | The normal force is the support force exerted upon an object that is in contact with another stable object. For example, if a book is resting upon a surface, then the surface is exerting an upward force upon the book in order to support the weight of the book. On occasions, a normal force is exerted horizontally between two objects that are in contact with each other. For instance, if a person leans against a wall, the wall pushes horizontally on the person.                    |
| **Friction Force (F_frict)**  ![Alt text](/images/topics/newtons-law/friction.jpg) | The friction force is the force exerted by a surface as an object moves across it or makes an effort to move across it. There are at least two types of friction force - sliding and static friction. Though it is not always the case, the friction force often opposes the motion of an object. For example, if a book slides across the surface of a desk, then the desk exerts a friction force in the opposite direction of its motion. Friction results from the two surfaces being pressed together closely, causing intermolecular attractive forces between molecules of different surfaces. As such, friction depends upon the nature of the two surfaces and upon the degree to which they are pressed together. The maximum amount of friction force that a surface can exert upon an object can be calculated using the formula: F_frict = µ • F_norm |
| **Air Resistance Force (F_air)** ![Alt text](/images/topics/newtons-law/air-resistance.jpg) | The air resistance is a special type of frictional force that acts upon objects as they travel through the air. The force of air resistance is often observed to oppose the motion of an object. This force will frequently be neglected due to its negligible magnitude (and due to the fact that it is mathematically difficult to predict its value). It is most noticeable for objects that travel at high speeds (e.g., a skydiver or a downhill skier) or for objects with large surface areas.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Tension Force (F_tens)**   ![Alt text](/images/topics/newtons-law/tension.jpg)  | The tension force is the force that is transmitted through a string, rope, cable or wire when it is pulled tight by forces acting from opposite ends. The tension force is directed along the length of the wire and pulls equally on the objects on the opposite ends of the wire.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Spring Force (F_spring)**  ![Alt text](/images/topics/newtons-law/spring.jpg)  | The spring force is the force exerted by a compressed or stretched spring upon any object that is attached to it. An object that compresses or stretches a spring is always acted upon by a force that restores the object to its rest or equilibrium position. For most springs (specifically, for those that are said to obey "Hooke's Law"), the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to the amount of stretch or compression of the spring.                                                                                                                                                          |


### **Sliding versus Static Friction**

The friction force is the force exerted by a surface as an object moves
across it or makes an effort to move across it. For the purpose of our
study of physics at The Physics Classroom, there are two types of
friction force - static friction and sliding friction. **Sliding
friction** results when an object slides across a surface. As an
example, consider pushing a box across a floor. 

![Alt text](/images/topics/newtons-law/friction.jpg)

The floor surface offers
resistance to the movement of the box. We often say that the floor
exerts a friction force upon the box. This is an example of a sliding
friction force since it results from the sliding motion of the box. If a
car slams on its brakes and skids to a stop (without antilock brakes),
there is a sliding friction force exerted upon the car tires by the
roadway surface. This friction force is also a sliding friction force
because the car is sliding across the road surface. Sliding friction
forces can be calculated from knowledge of the coefficient of friction
and the normal force exerted upon the object by the surface it is
sliding across. The formula is:

**Ffrict-sliding = μfrict-sliding • Fnorm**

The symbol **μfrict-sliding** represents the **coefficient of sliding
friction** between the two surfaces. The coefficient value is dependent
primarily upon the nature of the surfaces that are in contact with each
other. For most surface combinations, the friction coefficients show
little dependence upon other variables such as area of contact,
temperature, etc. Values of **μsliding** have been experimentally
determined for a variety of surface combinations and are often tabulated
in technical manuals and handbooks. The values of **μ** provide a
measure of the relative amount of adhesion or attraction of the two
surfaces for each other. The more that surface molecules tend to adhere
to each other, the greater the coefficient values and the greater the
friction force.

Friction forces can also exist when the two surfaces are not sliding
across each other. Such friction forces are referred to as static
friction. **Static friction** results when the surfaces of two objects
are at rest relative to one another and a force exists on one of the
objects to set it into motion relative to the other object. Suppose you
were to push with 5-Newton of force on a large box to move it across the
floor. The box might remain in place. A static friction force exists
between the surfaces of the floor and the box to prevent the box from
being set into motion. The static friction force balances the force that
you exert on the box such that the stationary box remains at rest. When
exerting 5 Newton of applied force on the box, the static friction force
has a magnitude of 5 Newton. Suppose that you were to push with 25
Newton of force on the large box and the box were to still remain in
place. Static friction now has a magnitude of 25 Newton. Then suppose
that you were to increase the force to 26 Newton and the box
finally budged from its resting position and was set into motion across
the floor. The box-floor surfaces were able to provide up to 25 Newton
of static friction force to match your applied force. Yet the two
surfaces were not able to provide 26 Newton of static friction force.
The amount of static friction resulting from the adhesion of any two
surfaces has an upper limit. In this case, the static friction force
spans the range from 0 Newton (if there is no force upon the box) to 25
Newton (if you push on the box with 25 Newton of force). This
relationship is often expressed as follows:

**Ffrict-static ≤ μfrict-static• Fnorm**

The symbol **μfrict-static** represents the **coefficient of static
friction** between the two surfaces. Like the coefficient of sliding
friction, this coefficient is dependent upon the types of surfaces that
are attempting to move across each other. In general, values of static
friction coefficients are greater than the values of sliding friction
coefficients for the same two surfaces. Thus, it typically takes more
force to budge an object into motion than it does to maintain the motion
once it has been started.

 

The meaning of each of these forces listed in the table above will have
to be thoroughly understood to be successful during this unit.
Ultimately, you must be able to read a verbal description of a physical
situation and know enough about these forces to recognize their presence
(or absence) and to construct a free-body diagram that illustrates their
relative magnitude and direction.

1\. Complete the following table showing the relationship between mass
and weight. 

| **Object**      | **Mass (kg)** | **Weight (N)** |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Melon           | 1 kg          |                |
| Apple           |               | 0.98 N         |
| Pat Eatladee    | 25 kg         |                |
| Fred            |               | 980 N          |


**Answer:**

**Mass (kg)**

Apple: **0.1 kg** (or \~0.098 kg if approximating **g** to be 10 m/s/s)

Fred: **100 kg** (or \~98 kg if approximating **g** to be 10 m/s/s)

**Weight (N)**

Melon: **9.8 N** (or \~10 N if approximating **g** to be 10 m/s/s)

Pat Eatladee: **245 N** (or \~250 N if approximating **g** to be 10
m/s/s)

2\. Different masses are hung on a spring scale calibrated in Newtons.

a.  The force exerted by gravity on 1 kg = 9.8 N.

b.  The force exerted by gravity on 5 kg = \_\_\_\_\_\_ N.

c.  The force exerted by gravity on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ kg = 98 N.

d.  The force exerted by gravity on 70 kg = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ N.

b. **49 N** (\~50 N if approximating **g** to be 10 m/s/s)

c. **10 kg** (\~9.8 kg if approximating **g** to be 10 m/s/s)

d. **686 N** (\~700 N if approximating **g** to be 10 m/s/s)

.3. When a person diets, is their goal to lose mass or to lose weight?
Explain.

Generally, people diet because they wish to reduce the amount of matter
on their body - they wish to remove the *blubber*. So people diet **to
lose mass**. If one wishes to lose weight, they could get a six fold
reduction by moving to the moon. Groovy

# ![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image15.png)Drawing Free-Body Diagrams

Free-body diagrams are diagrams used to show the relative magnitude and
direction of all forces acting upon an object in a given situation. A
free-body diagram is a special example of the vector diagrams that were
discussed [[in an earlier
unit]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L2c.cfm).
These diagrams will be used throughout our study of physics. The size of
the arrow in a free-body diagram reflects the magnitude of the force.
The direction of the arrow shows the direction that the force is acting.
Each force arrow in the diagram is labeled to indicate the exact type of
force. It is generally customary in a free-body diagram to represent the
object by a box and to draw the force arrow from the center of the box
outward in the direction that the force is acting. An example of a
free-body diagram is shown at the right

The free-body diagram above depicts four forces acting upon the object.
Objects do [not] necessarily always have four forces acting
upon them. There will be cases in which the number of forces depicted by
a free-body diagram will be one, two, or three. There is no hard and
fast rule about the number of forces that must be drawn in a free-body
diagram. The only *rule* for drawing free-body diagrams is to depict all
the forces that exist for that object in the given situation. Thus, to
construct free-body diagrams, it is extremely important to know
the [[various types of
forces]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l2b.cfm#Top).
If given a description of a physical situation, begin by using your
understanding of the force types to identify which forces are present.
Then determine the direction in which each force is acting. Finally,
draw a box and add arrows for each existing force in the appropriate
direction; label each force arrow according to its type. If necessary,
refer to [[the list of forces and their
description]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l2b.cfm#Help) in
order to understand the various force types and their appropriate
symbols.

# Determining the Net Force

In the statement of Newton\'s first law, the unbalanced force refers to
that force that does not become completely balanced (or canceled) by the
other individual forces. If either all the vertical forces (up and down)
do not cancel each other and/or all horizontal forces do not cancel each
other, then an unbalanced force exists. The existence of an unbalanced
force for a given situation can be quickly realized by looking at the
free-body diagram for that situation. Free-body diagrams for three
situations are shown below. Note that the actual magnitudes of the
individual forces are indicated on the diagram.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image24.png)

 

In each of the above situations, there is an unbalanced force. It is
commonly said that in each situation there is a net force acting upon
the object. The [net force] is the vector sum of all the
forces that act upon an object. That is to say, the net force is the sum
of all the forces, taking into account the fact that a force is a vector
and two forces of equal magnitude and opposite direction will cancel
each other out. At this point, the rules for summing vectors (such as
force vectors) will be kept relatively simple. Observe the following
examples of summing two forces:

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image25.png)

 

Observe in the diagram above that a downward vector will provide a
partial or full cancellation of an upward vector. And a leftward vector
will provide a partial or full cancellation of a rightward vector. The
addition of force vectors can be done in the same manner in order to
determine the net force (i.e., the vector sum of all the individual
forces). Consider the three situations below in which the net force is
determined by summing the individual force vectors that are acting upon
the objects.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image26.png)

### **A Net Force Causes an Acceleration**

A net force (i.e., an unbalanced force) causes an acceleration. In a
previous unit, several means of representing accelerated motion
(position-time and velocity-time graphs, ticker tape diagrams,
velocity-time data, etc.) were discussed. Combine your understanding of
acceleration and the newly acquired knowledge that a net force causes an
acceleration to determine whether or not a net force exists in the
following situations.

**Description of Motion**

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image27.png) 

Yes! There is a net force since there is an acceleration.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image28.png)

No! There is no net force since there is not an acceleration.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image29.png)

Yes! There is a net force since there is an acceleration

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image30.png)

No! There is a no net force since there is not an acceleration (zero
slope on a v-t graph means zero acceleration).

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image31.png)

Yes! There is a net force since there is an acceleration (the slope on a
v-t graph means acceleration).

Yes! There is a net force since there is an acceleration (the slope on a
v-t graph means acceleration).![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image32.png)

1\. Free-body diagrams for four situations are shown below. For each
situation, determine the net force acting upon the object. Click the
buttons to view the answers.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image33.png)**Answer**

**Situation A:**The net force is **zero Newtons**. All the individual
forces balance each other (i.e., cancel each other out).

**Situation B:**The net force is **5 Newtons, left**. The vertical
forces balance each other (i.e., cancel each other out). The leftward
force (friction) remains unbalanced.

**Situation C:**The net force is **zero Newtons**. All the individual
forces balance each other (i.e., cancel each other out).

**Situation D:**The net force is **15 Newtons, up**. The upward force of
air resistance is only partially balanced by the downward force of
gravity - 15 N of upward force remains unbalanced.

2\. Free-body diagrams for four situations are shown below. The net
force is known for each situation. However, the magnitudes of a few of
the individual forces are not known. Analyze each situation individually
and determine the magnitude of the unknown forces. Then click the button
to view the answers.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image34.png)**Answer**

**A = 50 N** (the horizontal forces must be balanced)

**B = 200 N** (the vertical forces must be balanced)

**C = 1100 N** (in order to have a net force of 200 N, up)

**D = 20 N** (in order to have a net force of 60 N, left)

**E = 300 N** (the vertical forces must be balanced)

**F = H = any number** you wish (as long as F equals H)

**G = 50 N** (in order to have a net force of 30 N, right)
