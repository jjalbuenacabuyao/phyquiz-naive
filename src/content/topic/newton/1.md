#  First Law

In this unit (Newton\'s Laws of Motion), the ways in which motion can
be explained will be discussed. Isaac Newton (a 17th century scientist)
put forth a variety of laws that explain why objects move (or don\'t
move) as they do. These three laws have become known as Newton\'s three
laws of motion. The focus of Lesson 1 is Newton\'s first law of motion -
sometimes referred to as the **law of inertia**.\
 

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image1.png)Newton\'s first law of motion is often stated as

An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion
with the same speed and in the same direction [[unless acted upon by an
unbalanced
force]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1d.cfm#balanced).

### **Two Clauses and a Condition**

There are two clauses or parts to this statement - one that predicts the
behavior of stationary objects and the other that predicts the behavior
of moving objects. The two parts are summarized in the following
diagram.

The behavior of all objects can be described by saying that objects tend
to \"keep on doing what they\'re doing\" ([[unless acted upon by an
unbalanced
force]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1d.cfm#balanced)).
If at rest, they will continue in this same state of rest. The state of
motion of an object is maintained as long as the object
is [not] acted upon by an unbalanced force. All objects
resist changes in their state of motion - they tend to \"keep on doing
what they\'re doing.\"

There is an important condition that must be met in order for the first
law to be applicable to any given motion. The condition is described by
the phrase \" unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.\" As the long as
the forces are not unbalanced - that is, as long as the forces are
balanced - the first law of motion applies. 

# Inertia and Mass

Newton\'s first law of motion states that \"An object at rest stays at
rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in
the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.\" Objects
tend to \"keep on doing what they\'re doing.\" In fact, it is the
natural tendency of objects to resist changes in their state of motion.
This tendency to resist changes in their state of motion is described
as **inertia**.

> Inertia: the resistance an object has to a change in its [[state of
> motion]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1c.cfm#state)

Newton\'s conception of inertia stood in direct opposition to more
popular conceptions about motion. The dominant thought prior to
Newton\'s day was that it was the natural tendency of objects to come to
a rest position. Moving objects, so it was believed, would eventually
stop moving; a force was necessary to keep an object moving. But if left
to itself, a moving object would eventually come to rest and an object
at rest would stay at rest; thus, the idea that dominated people\'s
thinking for nearly 2000 years prior to Newton was that it was the
natural tendency of all objects to assume a rest position.

 

### **Galileo and the Concept of Inertia**

Galileo, a premier scientist in the seventeenth century, developed the
concept of inertia. Galileo reasoned that moving objects eventually stop
because of a force called friction. In experiments using a pair of
inclined planes facing each other, Galileo observed that a ball would
roll down one plane and up the opposite plane to approximately the same
height. If smoother planes were used, the ball would roll up the
opposite plane even closer to the original height. Galileo reasoned that
any difference between initial and final heights was due to the presence
of friction. Galileo postulated that if friction could be entirely
eliminated, then the ball would reach exactly the same height.

Galileo further observed that regardless of the angle at which the
planes were oriented, the final height was almost always equal to the
initial height. If the slope of the opposite incline were reduced, then
the ball would roll a further distance in order to reach that original
height.

Galileo\'s reasoning continued - if the opposite incline were elevated
at nearly a 0-degree angle, then the ball would roll almost forever in
an effort to reach the original height. And if the opposing incline was
not even inclined at all (that is, if it were oriented along the
horizontal), then \... an object in motion would continue in motion\...
.

### **Forces Don\'t Keep Objects Moving**

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image5.png)Isaac Newton built on Galileo\'s thoughts about
motion. Newton\'s first law of motion declares that a force
is [not] needed to keep an object in motion. Slide a book
across a table and watch it slide to a rest position. The book in motion
on the table top does not come to a rest position because of
the absence of a force; rather it is the presence of a force - that
force being the force of friction - that brings the book to a rest
position. In the absence of a force of friction, the book would continue
in motion with the same speed and direction - forever! (Or at least to
the end of the table top.) A force is not required to keep a moving book
in motion. [[In actuality, it is a force that brings the book to
rest]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1d.cfm#friction).

### **Mass as a Measure of the Amount of Inertia**

All objects resist changes in their state of motion. All objects have
this tendency - they have inertia. But do some objects have more of a
tendency to resist changes than others? Absolutely yes! The tendency of
an object to resist changes in its state of motion varies with mass.
Mass is that quantity that is [solely] dependent upon the
inertia of an object. The more inertia that an object has, the more mass
that it has. A more massive object has a greater tendency to resist
changes in its state of motion.

# EXAMPLES

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image6.png)1. [Imagine] a place in
the cosmos far from all gravitational and frictional influences. Suppose
that you visit that place (just suppose) and throw a rock. The rock will

> a\. gradually stop.
>
> b\. continue in motion in the same direction at constant speed.

**Answer:**According to Newton\'s first law, the rock will continue in
motion in the same direction at constant speed

2\. A 2-kg object is moving horizontally with a speed of 4 m/s. How much
net force is required to keep the object moving at this speed and in
this direction?

**Answer:** **0 N**

An object in motion will maintain its state of motion. The presence of
an unbalanced force changes the velocity of the object.

 

3.  Mac and Tosh are arguing in the cafeteria. Mac says that if he
    flings the Jell-O with a greater speed it will have a greater
    inertia. Tosh argues that inertia does not depend upon speed, but
    rather upon mass. Who do you agree with? Explain why.

    **Tosh is correct.** Inertia is that quantity which depends solely
    upon mass. The more mass, the more inertia. Momentum is another
    quantity in Physics which depends on both mass and speed. Momentum
    will be discussed in a later unit.

     

4.  Supposing you were in space in a weightless environment, would it
    require a force to set an object in motion?

**Absolutely yes!**

Even in space objects have mass. And if they have mass, they have
inertia. That is, an object in space resists changes in its state of
motion. A force must be applied to set a stationary object in motion.
Newton\'s laws rule - everywhere!

 

5\. Fred spends most Sunday afternoons at rest on the sofa, watching pro
football games and consuming large quantities of food. What affect (if
any) does this practice have upon his inertia? Explain.

Fred\'s inertia will **increase**!

Fred will increase his mass if he makes a habit of this. And if his mass
increases, then his inertia increases.

 

6\. Ben Tooclose is being chased through the woods by a bull moose that
he was attempting to photograph. The enormous mass of the bull moose is
extremely intimidating. Yet, if Ben makes a zigzag pattern through the
woods, he will be able to use the large mass of the moose to his own
advantage. Explain this in terms of inertia and Newton\'s first law of
motion. 

 The large mass of the bull moose means that the bull moose has a large
inertia. Thus, Ben can more easily change his own state of motion (make
quick changes in direction) while the moose has extreme difficulty
changing its state of motion. Physics for better living!

7.  Two bricks are resting on edge of the lab table. Shirley She short
    stands on her toes and spots the two bricks. She acquires an intense
    desire to know which of the two bricks are most massive. Since
    Shirley is vertically challenged, she is unable to reach high enough
    and lift the bricks; she can however reach high enough to give the
    bricks a push. Discuss how the process of pushing the bricks will
    allow Shirley to determine which of the two bricks is most massive.
    What difference will Shirley observe and how can this observation
    lead to the necessary conclusion?

    The bricks, like any object, possess inertia. That is, the bricks
    will resist changes in their state of motion. If Shirley gives them
    a push, then the bricks will offer resistance to this push. The one
    with the most mass will be the one with the most inertia. This will
    be the brick which offers the most resistance. This very method of
    detecting the mass of an object can be used on Earth as well as in
    locations where gravitational forces are negligible for bricks.

# State of Motion

[[Inertia]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1b.cfm#inertia) is
the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. But
what is meant by the phrase state of motion? The state of motion of an
object is defined by
its [[velocity]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1d.cfm) -
the speed with a direction. Thus, inertia could be redefined as follows:

> **Inertia: tendency of an object to resist changes in its velocity.**

An object at rest has zero velocity - and (in the absence of an
unbalanced force) will remain with a zero velocity. Such an object will
not change its state of motion (i.e., velocity) unless acted upon by an
unbalanced force. An object in motion with a velocity of 2 m/s, East
will (in the absence of an unbalanced force) remain in motion with a
velocity of 2 m/s, East. Such an object will not change its state of
motion (i.e., velocity) unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
Objects resist changes in their velocity.

As learned [[in an earlier
unit]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1e.cfm),
an object that is not changing its velocity is said to have an
acceleration of 0 m/s/s. Thus, we could provide an alternative means of
defining inertia:

> **Inertia: tendency of an object to resist acceleration.**

### ![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image7.png)**EXAMPLE**

### 1. A group of physics teachers is taking some time off for a little putt-putt golf. The 15th hole at the Hole-In-One Putt-Putt Golf Course has a large metal rim that putters must use to guide their ball towards the hole. Mr. S guides a golf ball around the metal rim When the ball leaves the rim, which path (1, 2, or 3) will the golf ball follow?

** **The answer is **2**. Once leaving the rim, the ball will follow an
\"inertial path\" (i.e., a straight line). At the instant shown in the
diagram, the ball is moving to the right; once leaving the rim, there is
no more unbalanced forces to change its state of motion. Paths 1 and 3
both show the ball continually changing its direction once leaving the
rim.

2.  A 4.0-kg object is moving across a friction-free surface with a
    constant velocity of 2 m/s. Which one of the following horizontal
    forces is necessary to maintain this state of motion?

a.  0N b. 0.5 N c. 2.0 N d. 8.0 N e. depends on the speed

    If an object is in motion, then it will stay in motion with those
    very same motion characteristics. It doesn\'t take any force to
    maintain that same state of motion. In fact, the presence of a force
    would \"ruin\" such a state of motion and cause an acceleration.

# Balanced and Unbalanced Forces

[[Newton\'s first law of
motion]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1a.cfm#first) has
been frequently stated throughout this lesson.

An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion
with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an
unbalanced force.

### ![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image8.png)**Balanced Forces**

But what exactly is meant by the phrase **unbalanced force**? What is an
unbalanced force? In pursuit of an answer, we will first consider a
physics book at rest on a tabletop. There are two forces acting upon the
book. One force - the Earth\'s gravitational pull - exerts a downward
force. The other force - the push of the table on the book (sometimes
referred to as a normal force) - pushes upward on the book.\
 

 

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image9.png)Since these two forces are of equal magnitude and
in opposite directions, they balance each other. The book is said to be
at **equilibrium**. There is no unbalanced force acting upon the book
and thus the book maintains its [[state of
motion]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1c.cfm#state).
When all the forces acting upon an object balance each other, the object
will be at equilibrium; it will not accelerate. (Note: diagrams such as
the one above are known as [[free-body
diagrams]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l2c.cfm) and
will be discussed in detail in [[Lesson
2]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l2a.cfm).)

Consider another example involving balanced forces - a person standing
on the floor. There are two forces acting upon the person. The force of
gravity exerts a downward force. The floor exerts an upward force.

Since these two forces are of equal magnitude and in opposite
directions, they balance each other. The person is at equilibrium. There
is no unbalanced force acting upon the person and thus the person
maintains its [[state of
motion]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1c.cfm#state). 

### 

### 

### **Unbalanced Forces**

Now consider a book sliding from left to right across a tabletop.
Sometime in the prior history of the book, it may have been given a
shove and set in motion from a rest position. Or perhaps it acquired its
motion by sliding down an incline from an elevated position. Whatever
the case, our focus is not upon the history of the book but rather upon
the current situation of a book sliding to the right across a tabletop.
The book is in motion and at the moment there is no one pushing it to
the right. (Remember: [[a force is not needed to keep a moving object
moving to the
right]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1b.cfm#noforce).)
The forces acting upon the book are shown below.\
\
 The force of gravity pulling downward and the force of the table
pushing upwards on the book are of equal magnitude and opposite
directions. These two forces balance each other. Yet there is no force
present to balance the force of friction. As the book moves to the
right, friction acts to the left to slow the book down. There is an
unbalanced force; and as such, the book changes its state of motion. The
book is not at equilibrium and subsequently accelerates.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image10.png)

To determine if the forces acting upon an object are balanced or
unbalanced, an analysis must first be conducted to determine what forces
are acting upon the object and in what direction. If two individual
forces are of equal magnitude and opposite direction, then the forces
are said to be balanced. An object is said to be acted upon by an
unbalanced force only when there is an individual force that
is [not] being balanced by a force of equal magnitude and in
the opposite direction. 

# EXAMPLE

Luke Autbeloe drops an approximately 5.0 kg box of shingles (weight =
50.0 N) off the roof of his house into the swimming pool below. Upon
encountering the pool, the box encounters a 50.0 N upward resistance
force (assumed to be constant). Use this description to answer the
following questions. Click the button to view the correct answers.

1\. Which one of the velocity-time graphs best describes the motion of
the box? Support your answer with sound reasoning.

2\. Which one of the following dot diagrams best describes the motion of
the falling box from the time that they are dropped to the time that
they hit the bottom of the pool? The arrows on the diagram represent the
point at which the box hits the water. Support your answer with sound
reasoning.

3\. Several of Luke\'s friends were watching the motion of the falling
box. Being \"physics types\", they began discussing the motion and made
the following comments. Indicate whether each of the comments is correct
or incorrect? Support your answers.

**False.**

Once the box hits the water, the forces are balanced (50 N down and 50 N
up). The box would only bounce upwards if the water applied an upward
force greater than 50 N. As stated in the problem, the water applies
only 50 N of upward force. Furthermore, the upward force would first
contribute to slowing the box down (an upward acceleration) before it
could begin to actually move it upward

 

4\. If the forces acting upon an object are balanced, then the object

> a\. must not be moving.
>
> b\. must be moving with a constant velocity.
>
> c\. must not be accelerating.
>
> d\. none of these

The answer could be A (but does not have to be A) and it could be B (but
does not have to be B). An object having balanced forces definitely
cannot be accelerating. This means that it could be at rest and staying
at rest (one option) or could be in motion at constant velocity (a
second option). Either way, it definitely is not accelerating - choice C
of your four choices.
