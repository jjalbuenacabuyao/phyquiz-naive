# Newton\'s Third Law

According to Newton, whenever objects A and B interact with each other, they exert forces upon each other. When you sit in your chair, your body exerts a downward force on the chair and the chair exerts an upward force on your body. There are two forces resulting from this interaction - a force on the chair and a force on your body. These two forces are called action and reaction forces and are the subject of Newton\'s third law of motion. Formally stated, Newton\'s third law is:

> **For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.**

The statement means that in every interaction, there is a pair of forces
acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the
first object [equals] the size of the force on the second
object. The direction of the force on the first object
is [opposite] to the direction of the force on the second
object. Forces [always] come in pairs - equal and opposite
action-reaction force pairs.

### **Examples of Interaction Force Pairs**

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image48.png)A variety of action-reaction force pairs are
evident in nature. Consider the propulsion of a fish through the water.
A fish uses its fins to push water backwards. But a push on the water
will only serve to accelerate the water. Since forces result from mutual
interactions, the water must also be pushing the fish forwards,
propelling the fish through the water. The size of the force on the
water equals the size of the force on the fish; the direction of the
force on the water (backwards) is opposite the direction of the force on
the fish (forwards). For every action, there is an equal (in size) and
opposite (in direction) reaction force. Action-reaction force pairs make
it possible for fish to swim.

1\. While driving down the road, a firefly strikes the windshield of a
bus and makes a quite obvious mess in front of the face of the driver.
This is a clear case of Newton\'s third law of motion. The firefly hit
the bus and the bus hits the firefly. Which of the two forces is
greater: the force on the firefly or the force on the bus?** **

** **Trick Question! Each force is the same size. For every action,
there is an equal \... (equal!). The fact that the firefly splatters
only means that with its smaller mass, it is less able to withstand the
larger acceleration resulting from the interaction. Besides, fireflies
have guts and bug guts have a tendency to be *splatterable*. Windshields
don\'t have guts. There you have it.

2\. For years, space travel was believed to be impossible because there
was nothing that rockets could push off of in space in order to provide
the propulsion necessary to accelerate. This inability of a rocket to
provide propulsion is because \...

rifle recoils when fired. This recoil is the result of action-reaction
force pairs. A gunpowder explosion creates hot gases that expand outward
allowing the rifle to push forward on the bullet. Consistent with
Newton\'s third law of motion, the bullet pushes backwards upon the
rifle. The acceleration of the recoiling rifle is \...

5.  ![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image50.png)In the top picture (below), Kent Budgett is
    pulling upon a rope that is attached to a wall. In the bottom
    picture, Kent is pulling upon a rope that is attached to an
    elephant. In each case, the force scale reads 500 Newton. Kent is
    pulling ...

#### Kent is pulling with 500 N of force in each case. The rope transmits the force from Kent to the wall (or to the elephant) and vice versa. Since the force of Kent pulling on the wall and the wall pulling on Kent are action-reaction force pairs, they must have equal magnitudes.

## Identifying Interaction Force Pairs

According to [[Newton\'s third
law]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l4a.cfm#third),
for every action force there is an equal (in size) and opposite (in
direction) reaction force. Forces always come in pairs - known as
\"action-reaction force pairs.\" Identifying and describing
action-reaction force pairs is a simple matter of identifying the two
interacting objects and making two statements describing who is pushing
on whom and in what direction. For example, consider the interaction
between a baseball bat and a baseball.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image51.png)\
 

The baseball forces the bat to the left; the bat forces the ball to the
right. Together, these two forces exerted upon two different objects
form the action-reaction force pair. Note that in the description of the
two forces, the nouns in the sentence describing the forces simply
switch places.

Consider the following three examples. One of the forces in the mutual
interaction is described; describe the other force in the
action-reaction force pair. Click the button to view the answer.

**Answer: **The glove pushes the baseball rightward.

Bowling ball pushes pin leftwards.

**Answer: **Pin pushes bowling ball rightward.

outwards.

**Answer: **Balloon wall pushes enclosed air particles inwards.

1\. Consider the interaction depicted below between foot A, ball B, and
foot C. The three objects interact simultaneously (at the same time).
Identify the [two pairs] of action-reaction forces. Use the
notation \"foot A\", \"foot C\", and \"ball B\" in your statements.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image55.png)

The first pair of action-reaction force pairs is: foot A pushes ball B
to the right; and ball B pushes foot A to the left. The second pair of
action-reaction force pairs is: foot C pushes ball B to the left; and
ball B pushes foot C to the right.

2\. Identify at least six pairs of action-reaction force pairs in the
following diagram.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image56.png)

The elephant\'s feet push backward on the ground; the ground pushes
forward on its feet. The right end of the right rope pulls leftward on
the elephant\'s body; its body pulls rightward on the right end of the
right rope. The left end of the right rope pulls rightward on the man;
the man pulls leftward on the left end of the right rope. The right end
of the left rope pulls leftward on the man; the man pulls rightward on
the right end of the left rope. The tractor pulls leftward on the left
end of the left rope; the left end of the left rope pulls rightward on
the tractor. 

NEWTON'S LAW SUMMARY

1\. First Law (Law of Inertia):

An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion
with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an external
force.

Formula: F = 0 (when there is no net external force)

2\. Second Law (Law of Acceleration):

The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force
applied to it and inversely proportional to its mass.

Formula: F = m\*a (Force equals mass times acceleration)

3\. Third Law (Action-Reaction Law):

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Formula: F *action* = -F *reaction*

Types of Force:

1\. Applied Force:

Force applied to an object by a person or another object.
