# ![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image35.png)Newton\'s Second Law

Newton\'s second law of motion pertains to the behavior of objects for
which all existing forces are [not] balanced. The second law
states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two
variables - the [[net
force]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l2d.cfm) acting
upon the object and the mass of the object. The acceleration of an
object depends directly upon the net force acting upon the object, and
inversely upon the mass of the object. As the force acting upon an
object is increased, the acceleration of the object is increased. As the
mass of an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is
decreased.

### **The BIG Equation**

Newton\'s second law of motion can be formally stated as follows:

The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly
proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as
the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

### F = ma

**Formula:**

This verbal statement can be expressed in equation form as follows:

**a = Fnet / m**

The above equation is often rearranged to a more familiar form as shown
below. The net force is equated to the product of the mass times the
acceleration.

**Fnet = m • a**

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image36.png)In this entire discussion, the emphasis has been
on the net force. The acceleration is directly proportional to the net
force; the net force equals mass times acceleration; the acceleration in
the same direction as the net force; an acceleration is produced by
a net force. The NET FORCE. It is important to remember this
distinction. Do not use the value of merely \"any \'ole force\" in the
above equation. It is the net force that is related to
acceleration. [[As discussed in an earlier
lesson]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l2d.cfm#net),
the net force is the vector sum of all the forces. If all the individual
forces acting upon an object are known, then the net force can be
determined. If necessary, review this principle by returning to
the [[practice questions in Lesson
2]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l2d.cfm#Practice).

 

Consistent with the above equation, a unit of force is equal to a unit
of mass times a unit of acceleration. By substituting standard metric
units for force, mass, and acceleration into the above equation, the
following unit equivalency can be written.

**1 Newton = 1 kg • m/s2**

The definition of the standard metric unit of force is stated by the
above equation. One Newton is defined as the amount of force required to
give a 1-kg mass an acceleration of 1 m/s/s.

1\. Determine the accelerations that result when a 12-N net force is
applied to a 3-kg object and then to a 6-kg object.\
 A 3-kg object experiences an acceleration of **4 m/s/s**. A 6-kg object
experiences an acceleration of **2 m/s/s**.

2\. A net force of 15 N is exerted on an encyclopedia to cause it to
accelerate at a rate of 5 m/s2. Determine the mass of the encyclopedia.\
 Use Fnet= m \* a with Fnet = 15 N and a = 5 m/s/s.

So (15 N) = (m)\*(5 m/s/s)

And **m = 3.0 kg**

3\. Suppose that a sled is accelerating at a rate of 2 m/s2. If the net
force is tripled and the mass is doubled, then what is the new
acceleration of the sled?\
 Answer: **3 m/s/s**

The original value of 2 m/s/s must be multiplied by 3 (since a and F are
directly proportional) and divided by 2 (since a and m are inversely
proportional)

3.  Suppose that a sled is accelerating at a rate of 2 m/s2. If the net
    force is tripled and the mass is halved, then what is the new
    acceleration of the sled?

Answer: **12 m/s/s**

The original value of 2 m/s/s must be multiplied by 3 (since a and F are
directly proportional) and divided by 1/2 (since a and m are inversely
proportional)

# Finding Acceleration

In this lesson, we will learn how to determine the acceleration of an
object if the magnitudes of all the individual forces are known. The
three major equations that will be useful are the equation for net force
([[Fnet =
m•a]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l3a.cfm)),
the equation for [[gravitational
force]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l2b.cfm#grav) (Fgrav =
m•g), and the equation for [[frictional
force]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l2b.cfm#frict) (Ffrict =
μ • Fnorm).

The process of determining the acceleration of an object demands that
the mass and the net force are known. If mass (m) and net force (Fnet)
are known, then the acceleration is determined by use of the equation.

**a = Fnet / m**

### **EXAMPLES:**

An applied force of 50 N is used to accelerate an object to the right
across a frictional surface. The object encounters 10 N of friction. Use
the diagram to determine the normal force, the net force, the mass, and
the acceleration of the object. (Neglect air resistance.)

Note: To simplify calculations, an approximated value of g is often
used - 10 m/s/s. Answers obtained using this approximation are shown in
parenthesis.

 

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image37.png)**Fnorm = 80 N; m = 8.16 kg; Fnet = 40 N, right;
a = 4.9 m/s/s, right**

( Fnorm = 80 N; m = 8 kg; Fnet = 40 N, right; a = 5 m/s/s, right )

Since there is no vertical acceleration, normal force = gravity force.

The mass can be found using the equation Fgrav = m • g.

The Fnet is the vector sum of all the forces: 80 N, up plus 80 N, down
equals 0 N. And 50 N, right plus 10 N, left = 40 N, right.

Finally, a = Fnet / m = (40 N) / (8.16 kg) = 4.9 m/s/s.

An applied force of 20 N is used to accelerate an object to the right
across a frictional surface. The object encounters 10 N of friction. Use
the diagram to determine the normal force, the net force, the
coefficient of friction (μ) between the object and the surface, the
mass, and the acceleration of the object. (Neglect air resistance.)

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image38.png)**Fnorm = 100 N; m = 10.2 kg; Fnet = 10 N,
right; \"mu\" = 0.1; a =0.980 m/s/s, right**

( Fnorm = 100 N; m = 10 kg; Fnet = 10 N, right; \"mu\" = 0.1; a =1
m/s/s, right )

Since there is no vertical acceleration, the normal force is equal to
the gravity force.

The mass can be found using the equation Fgrav = m \* g.

Using \"mu\" = Ffrict / Fnorm, \"mu\" = (10 N) / (100 N) = 0.1.

The Fnet is the vector sum of all the forces: 100 N, up plus 100 N, down
equals 0 N. And 20 N, right plus 10 N, left = 10 N, right.

Finally, a = Fnet / m = (10 N) / (10.2 kg) = 0.980 m/s/s.

A 5-kg object is sliding to the right and encountering a friction force
that slows it down. The coefficient of friction (μ) between the object
and the surface is 0.1. Determine the force of gravity, the normal
force, the force of friction, the net force, and the acceleration.
(Neglect air resistance.)

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image39.png)**Fgrav = 49 N; Fnorm = 49 N; Ffrict = 4.9 N;
Fnet = 5 N, left; a = 0.98 m/s/s, left**

**( Fgrav = 50 N; Fnorm = 50 N; Ffrict = 5 N; Fnet = 5 N, left; a = 1
m/s/s, left )**

Fgrav = m • g = (5 kg) • (9.8 m/s/s) = 49 N.

Since there is no vertical acceleration, the normal force equals the
gravity force.

Ffrict can be found using the equation Ffrict =\"mu\"• Fnorm.

The Fnet is the vector sum of all the forces: 49 N, up plus 49 N, down
equals 0 N. And 4.9 N, left remains unbalanced; it is the net force.

Finally, a = Fnet / m = (4.9 N) / (5 kg) = 0.98 m/s/s.

1.  Edwardo applies a 4.25-N rightward force to a 0.765-kg book to
    accelerate it across a tabletop. The coefficient of friction between
    the book and the tabletop is 0.410. Determine the acceleration of
    the book.

**Fgrav = 7.50 N; Fnorm = 7.50 N; Ffrict = 3.07 N; Fnet = 1.18 N,
right; a = 1.54 m/s/s, right**

2\. In a physics lab, Kate and Rob use a hanging mass and pulley system
to exert a 2.45 N rightward force on a 0.500-kg cart to accelerate it
across a low-friction track. If the total resistance force to the motion
of the cart is 0.72 N, then what is the cart\'s acceleration?

**Fgrav = 4.90 N; Fnorm = 4.90 N; Fnet = 1.73 N, right; a = 3.46 m/s/s,

# Finding Individual Forces

The process of determining the value of the individual forces acting
upon an object involve an application of Newton\'s second law (Fnet=m•a)
and an application of the meaning of the net force. If mass (m) and
acceleration (a) are known, then the net force (Fnet) can be determined
by use of the equation.

**Fnet = m • a**

If the numerical value for the net force and the direction of the net
force is known, then the value of all individual forces can be
determined. Thus, the task involves using the above equations, the given
information, and your understanding of net force to determine the value
of individual forces.

### **EXAMPLES**

1.  Lee Mealone is sledding with his friends when he becomes disgruntled
    by one of his friend\'s comments. He exerts a rightward force of
    9.13 N on his 4.68-kg sled to accelerate it across the snow. If the
    acceleration of the sled is 0.815 m/s/s, then what is the
    coefficient of friction between the sled and the snow?\
    \
     **Fgrav = 45.9 N; Fnorm = 45.9 N; Ffrict = 5.32 N; Fnet = 3.81 N,
    right; mu = 0.116**

    The starting point for any problem such as this is the construction
    of a free-body diagram in which you show all the individual forces
    which are acting upon the book. There are two vertical forces -
    gravity and normal force. There are two horizontal forces - friction
    and the applied force.

Since there is no vertical acceleration, normal force = gravity force.
Each of these forces can be determined using the equation Fgrav = m • g
= (4.68 kg) • (9.8 m/s/s) = 45.864 N

The net force can be determined from knowledge of the mass and
acceleration of the sled. Fnet = m • a = (4.68 kg) • (0.815 m/s/s) =
3.8142 N, right.

Since the net force is to the right (in the direction of the applied
force), then the applied force must be greater than the friction force.
The friction force can be determined using an understanding of net force
as the vector sum of all the forces. So 3.81 N, right = 9.13 N, right +
Ffrict. Therefore, Ffrict = 5.32 N, left.

The coefficient of friction can now be determined as the ratio of
friction force to normal force. \"mu\" = Ffrict / Fnorm = (5.32 N) /
(45.864 N) = 0.116.

2.  In a Physics lab, Ernesto and Amanda apply a 34.5 N rightward force
    to a 4.52-kg cart to accelerate it across a horizontal surface at a
    rate of 1.28 m/s/s. Determine the friction force acting upon the
    cart.

**Ffrict = 28.7 N, left**

The starting point for any problem such as this is the construction of a
free-body diagram in which you show all the individual forces which are
acting upon the book. There are two vertical forces - gravity and normal
force. There are two horizontal forces - friction and the applied force.

Since there is no vertical acceleration, normal force = gravity force.
Each of these forces can be determined using the equation Fgrav = m • g
= (4.52 kg) • (9.8 m/s/s) = 44.296 N

The net force can be determined from knowledge of the mass and
acceleration of the sled. Fnet = m • a = (4.52 kg) • (1.28 m/s/s) =
5.7856 N, right.

Since the net force is to the right (in the direction of the applied
force), then the applied force must be greater than the friction force.
The friction force can be determined using an understanding of net force
as the vector sum of all the forces. So 5.7856 N, right = 34.5 N,
right + Ffrict. Therefore, Ffrict = 28.7 N, left.

A rightward force is applied to a 6-kg object to move it across a rough
surface at constant velocity. The object encounters 15 N of frictional
force. Use the diagram to determine the gravitational force, normal
force, net force, and applied force. (Neglect air resistance.)

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image40.png)**Fnet = 0 N; Fgrav = 58.8 N; Fnorm = 58.8 N;
Fapp = 15 N**

When the velocity is constant, a = 0 m/s/s and Fnet = 0 N

Since the mass is known, Fgrav can be found: Fgrav = m • g = 6 kg • 9.8
m/s/s = 58.8 N

Since there is no vertical acceleration, the normal force equals the
gravity force.

Since there is no horizontal acceleration, Ffrict = Fapp = 15 N

A rightward force is applied to a 10-kg object to move it across a rough
surface at constant velocity. The coefficient of friction between the
object and the surface is 0.2. Use the diagram to determine the
gravitational force, normal force, applied force, frictional force, and
net force. (Neglect air resistance.)

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image41.png)**Fnet = 0 N; Fgrav = 98 N; Fnorm = 98 N;
Ffrict = 19.6 N; Fapp = 19.6 N**

When the velocity is constant, a = 0 m/s/s and Fnet = 0 N

Since the mass is known, Fgrav can be found (Fgrav = m • g = 10 kg • 9.8
m/s/s). Since there is no vertical acceleration, normal force = gravity
force. Once Fnorm is known, Ffrict can be found using Ffrict = \"mu\"
•Fnorm. Since there is no horizontal acceleration, Ffrict = Fapp = 19.6
N

A rightward force is applied to a 5-kg object to move it across a rough
surface with a rightward acceleration of 2 m/s/s. The coefficient of
friction between the object and the surface is 0.1. Use the diagram to
determine the gravitational force, normal force, applied force,
frictional force, and net force. (Neglect air resistance.)

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image42.png)**Fnet =10 N, right; Fgrav = 49 N; Fnorm = 49 N;
Ffrict = 4.9 N; Fapp = 14.9 N**

Fnet can be found using Fnet = m • a = (5 kg) • (2 m/s/s) = 10 N, right.

Since the mass is known, Fgrav can be found: Fgrav = m • g = 5 kg • 9.8
m/s/s = 49 N

Since there is no vertical acceleration, the normal force equals the
gravity force.

Once Fnorm is known, Ffrict can be found using Ffrict = \"mu\" • Fnorm =
(0.1) • (49 N) = 4.9 N.

Since the Fnet = 10 N, right, the rightward force (Fapp) must be 10 N
more than the leftward force (Ffrict); thus, Fapp must be 14.9 N.

A rightward force of 25 N is applied to a 4-kg object to move it across
a rough surface with a rightward acceleration of 2.5 m/s/s. Use the
diagram to determine the gravitational force, normal force, frictional
force, net force, and the coefficient of friction between the object and
the surface. (Neglect air resistance.)

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image43.png)**Fnet = 10 N, right; Fgrav = 39.2 N; Fnorm =
39.2 N; Ffrict = 15 N; \"mu\"= 0.383**

Fnet can be found using Fnet = m • a = (4 kg) • (2.5 m/s/s) =10 N,
right.

Since the mass is known, Fgrav can be found: Fgrav = m • g = 4 kg • 9.8
m/s/s = 39.2 N.

Since there is no vertical acceleration, the normal force equals the
gravity force.

Since the Fnet=10 N, right, the rightward force (Fapp) must be 10 N more
than the leftward force (Ffrict); thus, Ffrict must be 15 N.

Finally, \"mu\"= Ffrict / Fnorm = (15 N) / (39.2 N) = 0.383.

# Free Fall and Air Resistance

In addition to an exploration of free fall, the motion of objects that
encounter air resistance will also be analyzed. In particular, two
questions will be explored:

-   Why do objects that encounter air resistance ultimately reach a
    terminal velocity?

-   In situations in which there is air resistance, why do more massive
    objects fall faster than less massive objects?

To answer the above questions, [[Newton\'s second
law]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l3a.cfm) of
motion (Fnet = m•a) will be applied to analyze the motion of objects
that are falling under the sole influence of gravity (free fall) and
under the dual influence of gravity and air resistance.

** **

### ** **

### **Free Fall Motion**

As learned in an earlier unit, free fall is a special type of motion in
which the only force acting upon an object is gravity. Objects that are
said to be undergoing free fall, are not encountering a significant
force of air resistance; they are falling under the sole influence of
gravity. Under such conditions, [[all objects will fall with the same
rate of acceleration, regardless of their
mass]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L5e.cfm).
But why? Consider the free-falling motion of a 1000-kg baby elephant and
a 1-kg overgrown mouse.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image44.png)\
 

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image45.png)If [[Newton\'s second
law]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l3a.cfm) were
applied to their falling motion, and if a [[free-body
diagram]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l2c.cfm) were
constructed, then it would be seen that the 1000-kg baby elephant would
experiences a greater force of gravity. This greater force of gravity
would have a direct effect upon the elephant\'s acceleration; thus,
based on force alone, it might be thought that the 1000-kg baby elephant
would accelerate faster. But acceleration depends upon two factors:
force and mass. The 1000-kg baby elephant obviously has more mass (or
inertia). This increased mass has an inverse effect upon the elephant\'s
acceleration. And thus, the direct effect of greater force on the
1000-kg elephant is offset by the inverse effect of the greater mass of
the 1000-kg elephant; and so each object accelerates at the same rate -
approximately 10 m/s/s. The ratio of force to mass (Fnet/m) is the same
for the elephant and the mouse under situations involving free fall.

This ratio (Fnet/m) is sometimes called the **gravitational field
strength** and is expressed as 9.8 N/kg (for a location upon Earth\'s
surface). The gravitational field strength is a property of the location
within Earth\'s gravitational field and not a property of the baby
elephant nor the mouse. All objects placed upon Earth\'s surface will
experience this amount of force (9.8 N) upon every 1 kilogram of mass
within the object. Being a property of the location within Earth\'s
gravitational field and not a property of the free falling object
itself, all objects on Earth\'s surface will experience this amount of
force per mass. As such, all objects free fall at the same rate
regardless of their mass. Because the 9.8 N/kg gravitational field at
Earth\'s surface causes a 9.8 m/s/s acceleration of any object placed
there, we often call this ratio the acceleration of gravity. 

Why does an object that encounters air resistance eventually reach a
terminal velocity? To answer this questions, [[Newton\'s second
law]](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l3a.cfm) will
be applied to the motion of a falling skydiver.

![](/images/topics/newtons-law/image46.png)In the diagrams below, free-body diagrams
showing the forces acting upon an 85-kg skydiver (equipment included)
are shown. For each case, use the diagrams to determine the net force
and acceleration of the skydiver at each instant in time. Then use the

The **Fnet = 833 N, down** and the **a =9.8 m/s/s, down**

a = (Fnet / m) = (833 N) / (85 kg) = 9.8 m/s/s

The **Fnet = 483 N, down** and the **a = 5.68 m/s/s, down**

a = (Fnet / m) = (483 N) / (85 kg) = 5.68 m/s/s

The **Fnet = 133 N, down** and the **a = 1.56 m/s/s, down**

a = (Fnet / m) = (133 N) / (85 kg) = 1.56 m/s/s

The **Fnet = 0 N** and the **a = 0 m/s/s**

a = (Fnet / m) = (0 N) / (85 kg) = 0 m/s/s.
